- `GET /oauth/callback`: OAuth callback handler
- `GET /logout`: Logs out the current user
- `GET /auth/status`: Checks authentication status
- `GET /api/session`: Verifies session status

### Task Management

- `POST /addtask`: Adds a task to the to-do list and calendar

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Interest-Based Filtering

The system filters email suggestions based on your selected interests. For example, if you're interested in "Hackathons" and "Internships", only emails related to these topics will generate task suggestions.

### Smart Date Extraction

RunDown uses AI to extract specific dates and times mentioned in emails. For example, if an email mentions "Meeting on March 22nd at 10:30 AM", the system will create the calendar event at that exact date and time.

### Calendar Integration

Tasks in RunDown are automatically synchronized with Microsoft Calendar:
- Adding a task creates a calendar event
- Deleting a task removes the corresponding calendar event
- Events include reminders (30 minutes before)

### Email Processing

The system scans your inbox for actionable emails and:
1. Analyzes the content to determine if it contains tasks or events
2. Extracts relevant information like dates, times, and locations
3. Creates task suggestions based on this information
4. Marks processed emails with a special category to avoid duplication

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- **Error 401/403**: Clear your browser cookies and try logging in again
- **OAuth Error**: Verify that your client secret is correct and redirect URIs are configured properly

### Calendar Event Timing Issues

- **Wrong Event Times**: The system may sometimes misinterpret dates or times. Manually adjust the event in Microsoft Calendar if needed.

### Email Processing Issues

- **Missing Suggestions**: Verify your interest preferences to ensure they match the email content
- **Duplicate Suggestions**: The system should avoid showing already processed emails, but occasionally duplicates may appear

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Mobile application support
- Integration with other email providers
- Advanced natural language processing for better task extraction
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud-based deployment
- Database storage instead of file-based storage
- Enhanced analytics and reporting

1. Analyzes the content to determine if it contains tasks or events
2. Extracts relevant information like dates, times, and locations
3. Creates task suggestions based on this information
4. Marks processed emails with a special label to avoid duplication

### Smart Duplicate Prevention

RunDown uses multiple strategies to prevent duplicate tasks:

1. **Email ID Tracking**: Stores email IDs when creating tasks from emails to prevent re-suggesting the same email
2. **Event ID Comparison**: Checks calendar event IDs to avoid duplicate entries
3. **Text Matching**: Compares task text to prevent similar tasks from being added multiple times
4. **Cross-Interface Deduplication**: Tasks added via the chatbot won't appear in suggestions and vice versa

### AI Chatbot Commands

The built-in AI chatbot supports command prefixes for quick task management:

- **@add [event details]**: Creates a new calendar event and adds it to your task list
  - Extracts dates, times, and locations from your description
  - Uses natural language processing to understand relative dates (tomorrow, next week, etc.)
  - Defaults to appropriate times if not specified
  
- **@remove [event name]**: Deletes an event from your calendar and task list
  - Finds the best matching event based on your description
  - Confirms successful deletion

- **@list**: Shows your upcoming calendar events
  - Displays events in chronological order
  - Includes date, time, and location information

- **@check [date]**: Checks your availability on a specific date
  - Shows all booked events for that day
  - Lists available time slots for scheduling
  - Works with natural language date references ("next Monday", "tomorrow", etc.)

- **@when [query]**: Finds times when you're available for an event
  - Analyzes your calendar for the specified day
  - Shows all free time slots
  - Works with queries like "When am I free tomorrow?"

- **@suggest [event details]**: Suggests optimal times for scheduling events
  - Analyzes your calendar to find suitable free time slots
  - Considers event duration and time preferences (morning, afternoon, etc.)
  - Offers to add the event to your calendar with a simple confirmation
  - Example: "@suggest time for a 1-hour coffee meeting tomorrow afternoon"

- **@help**: Provides information on available commands
  - Shows detailed usage examples
  - Offers tips for effective command usage

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- **Error 401/403**: Clear your browser cookies and try logging in again
- **OAuth Error**: Verify that your credentials.json file is correct and OAuth consent screen is configured properly

### Calendar Event Timing Issues

- **Wrong Event Times**: The system may sometimes misinterpret dates or times. Manually adjust the event in Google Calendar if needed.
- **Default 9 AM Events**: If events are consistently created at 9 AM despite having specific times in emails, check the console logs for date parsing errors.

### Email Processing Issues

- **Missing Suggestions**: Verify your interest preferences to ensure they match the email content
- **Duplicate Suggestions**: The system should avoid showing already processed emails, but occasionally duplicates may appear

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Mobile application support
- Integration with other email providers
- Advanced natural language processing for better task extraction
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud-based deployment
- Database storage instead of file-based storage
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
