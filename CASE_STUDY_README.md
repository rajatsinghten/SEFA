### **CASE STUDY PROMPT FOR PDF GENERATION**

**Title**: "RunDown: Migrating Email & Calendar Integration from Google to Microsoft Graph API"

**Create a 5-6 page PDF case study covering the following sections:**

#### **Page 1: Executive Summary & Problem Statement**
- **Project Title**: RunDown - AI-Powered Email & Calendar Manager
- **Team Size**: Individual/Group project
- **Technology Stack**: Python Flask, Microsoft Graph API, MSAL, Azure AD, Google Generative AI
- **Problem Statement**: 
  - Original application used Google Gmail and Calendar APIs
  - Client requested migration to Microsoft ecosystem for better enterprise integration
  - Need to maintain all existing functionality while switching authentication and API providers
- **Objectives**:
  - Complete API migration without feature loss
  - Implement proper OAuth2 authentication with Microsoft
  - Maintain AI-powered task extraction capabilities
  - Ensure scalable architecture for enterprise deployment

#### **Page 2: Technical Architecture & Approach**
- **Original Architecture**:
  - Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication
  - Gmail API for email processing
  - Google Calendar API for event management
  - File-based encrypted token storage
- **New Architecture**:
  - Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for OAuth
  - Microsoft Graph API for unified email/calendar access
  - Azure AD integration for enterprise authentication
  - Enhanced error handling and token refresh mechanisms
- **Migration Strategy**:
  - Incremental component replacement
  - Parallel testing during development
  - Comprehensive authentication flow redesign

  - `utils/auth.py`: MSAL-based authentication system
  - `utils/outlook.py`: Microsoft Graph email integration
  - `utils/calendar.py`: Calendar event management via Graph API
  - Token management with automatic refresh capabilities
- **Major Challenges Encountered**:
  1. **Authentication Flow Complexity**: Microsoft OAuth requires different consent mechanisms
  2. **API Differences**: Different response formats between Google and Microsoft APIs
  3. **Permission Management**: External user account limitations and consent requirements
  4. **Token Lifecycle**: Handling token expiration and refresh in production environment
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Force re-consent mechanism for proper permission granting
  - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly guidance
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues
  - Fallback mechanisms for API failures

#### **Page 4: Development Process & DevOps Practices**
- **Development Methodology**:
  - Incremental migration approach
  - Feature-by-feature replacement and testing
  - Comprehensive error logging and debugging
- **Code Quality Practices**:
  - Modular architecture with separated concerns
  - Configuration management via environment variables
  - Encrypted credential storage
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Testing & Validation**:
  - Token validation and API testing scripts
  - Multi-endpoint testing for permission verification
  - User authentication flow testing
  - API response handling validation
- **Deployment Considerations**:
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Azure app registration requirements
  - Redirect URI configuration for production/development
  - Security best practices for client secrets

#### **Page 5: Results & Learnings**
